Reinforcement learning faces a scaling problem [CITE: XYZ].
As the state and action spaces grow, standard techniques, such as those canvassed in the previous section, falter.
Yet real-world environments feature essentially infinite state and action spaces.
If reinforcement learning is to provide satisfying explanations of rational behavior beyond the confines of the lab, it must tame this complexity [CITE: Sutton Barto, etc.].\footnote{In addition, real-world environments are likely not to be Markov, so some extension of the framework is required here.
See the discussion in [CITE: Sutton and Barto, ch. 17] for some options.}
