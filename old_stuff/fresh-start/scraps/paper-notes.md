the selection problem is interesting.
i think there's something important about it, could be a good angle
but this is note quite the same as the presence of mental representations, or their form.
one question is to clarify the meaning of "selection"—this sounds mentalistic, so what's really meant?

also, selection = guidance?
it's tempting to talk in terms of guidance.
but what sort of guidance is at play?
are there different kinds?
    - attention
    - intentions
    - habit?

important point: S&W want to analyze know-how.
they claim that it is not a capacity
but they might still think there are practical capacities and maybe even that they're connected to know-how
they could respond to all this saying, yeah, those are all practical capacities, but they're not know-how
knowing how to play the piano is not the same as having a capacity to play the piano
what I need, though, is that having a capacity to play the piano requires knowing how to play the piano.
this might be questioned: examples of capacity without know-how?
    - J has the capacity to ...?

my topic is the practical capacities.
I want to know what is required by way of mental structure for the possession of a practical capacity—the capacity to grasp rods, and the capacity to write an essay.
Intuitively, the latter requires kinds of capacities that the former does not.
Writing an essay requires producing language, for example

There are also the cases: take the rat that can reliably find its way out of the maze, or the dog that is capable of catching my frisbee.
These animals also know how to do these things, in _some_ sense of the term.
My interest is in know-how in that sense.
I am not particularly interested in figuring out what property ``knows how to $\varphi$'' normally expresses as a bit of English.

lessons from RL:
    - possessing practical capacities (and hence knowing-how, in some good sense of the term) does not require knowledge-that
    - possessing practical capacities does not require representing ways of doing actions.
    - Ryle was right: intelligent behavior does not require "contemplation of a proposition"
