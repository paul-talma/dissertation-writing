Artificial Value

Valuing is an important capacity of ours.
It allows us to regulate our conduct against certain important standards, provides an interesting and flexible source of motivation, and facilitates a compact form of moral communication.

Could a machine value?
Could a baboon?
These questions are important for a few reasons.
Given the importance of valuing in our lives, we would naturally like to know whether this capacity is distinctively human.
We would also like to understand this capacity. Answering the above questions requires us to clarify the nature of valuing.

Finally, it has been a long-standing goal of the field of artificial intelligence to build machines that are like humans in various more or less cognitive respects.
Most attention has been spent on getting machines to instantiate some (perhaps thin) form of epistemic or practical rationality, and to achieve (perhaps thin) forms of perceptual and motor capacities.

- The statistical learning tradition in machine learning is the computational implementation of inductively sound inference. Planning algorithms instantiate some kind of means-end rationality. Computer vision has made great strides in endowing computers with perceptual capacities. And likewise, robotics develops algorithms and hardware that implement a variety of important practical capacities, such as grasping and navigation.

Less has been spent on the value-oriented aspects of our cognition. But given the important connections between valuing, acting, and reasoning,

# Value

This section clarifies the theoretical target: valuing, or valuation.

Valuing has been discussed in philosophy primarily in the context of debates concerning free action.
[This may be false, actually.]
On one approach, free action is action that issues from a motivational state with the right structure.
On Frankfurt's original account, for example, an action is free if it is caused by a desire, and if we desire that desire to cause our actions [perhaps _cause_ is not the right relation here].
The relevant structure is a kind of consistency among our desires of various orders.
Many philosophers (starting with Watson's "Free Agency") have read Frankfurt as identifying the self with one's higher-order desires.
They have justly asked why these desires, but not the first-order ones, deserve such a title.
The notion of valuing is supposed to be of help here: 

## Values, valuables, and valuing
- Distinguish between values, valuable objects or states of affairs (bearers of value), and the activity or state of valuing.
- Our focus is on the latter.
    - Valuing as a mental state:
        - State construal: valuing is a mental state consisting of assigning or ascribing value to objects or states of affairs.
        - Clarify connection to beliefs: not just a belief that such and such is valuable.
        - Instead, valuing has a more direct connection to action; and can motivate.
        - Nonetheless, valuing has representational content, similarly to how intentions have representational content without being beliefs.
    - Valuing as an activity
        - Values call for various responses.
        - To respond in a called-for way (perhaps: for the right reasons, etc.) is to value the valuable thing.
        - For example, acting to preserve coral reefs might be a way to value---to engage in the valuing of---the reefs (or the local biodiversity).
            - Not all valuing consists in or requires preservation (see Scanlon, Pettit).
        - Tangentially related: there is a specific activity called "valuing" which consists in determining the (often market) value of something. For example, an art dealer might value a painting at a certain price. Depending on how one thinks about the kind of value in question, this can be understood as trying to ascertain the (in some sense) objective value of the object, or of setting its value (as when a store sets a price for an item).
    - Valuing as a disposition
        - Valuing consists in having a disposition to act, feel, and be motivated in certain ways.
        - For example, to value the reefs is to be disposed to act so as to preserve them (given the opportunity), to feel sadness or grief at their destruction, and to want or intend to act "on their behalf" (as steward, say). Valuing a work of art might consist in a disposition to view the work given the chance, and likewise to be distressed by its destruction, etc.
    - Valuing as computation
        - (This need not be distinct from some of the foregoing, but perhaps a special case)
        - Haas: to value is to attribute reward and reward-conduciveness to things (very broadly---actions, object, states, etc.). 
        - She doesn't say what it is to "attribute reward" to such things. But since her account is meant to be an explication of valuing as encountered in RL, a reasonable guess is that you attribute reward to these states when you compute a reward signal from a representation of the relevant state/action/object/etc.

    - Valuing as representation
        - Aronowitz argues that one can value by representing one's environment in a certain way.
        - Specifically, she argues that "part of the cognitive basis of valuing" consists in state space representations (ways of specifying (possibly sequential) decision problems).
        - For example, I can divide up routes to school according to length, or according to length and scenic quality. The latter treats aesthetic differences as relevant to decision-making and hence constitutes my valuing the beauty of my route to school.
            - To be honest, I haven't yet figured out what Aronowitz wants to say---the paper is not the clearest. Something along the lines of the above seems right.


Ways of valuing
    - Corresponding to kinds of value, there are ways of valuing.
        - Instrumental/non-instrumental value, likewise instrumental/non-instrumental valuing
        - Similarly for intrinsic/extrinsic, partly/wholly valuable and valuing.
        - In general: different ways of valuing consist in ascribing different kinds of value to objects/states of affairs.

## Function of valuing
    - Consider belief:
        - We have a capacity to form beliefs. This capacity has several functions: to assist in planning, decision-making, to produce true beliefs, etc. Some of these functions are not related to truth in an essential way: the biological function of the capacity is to aid in survival and reproduction (though issuing true beliefs might make a very strong contribution to survival, the two are conceptually  distinct).
        - In addition, individual beliefs have functions, perhaps derived from the function of the capacity (or perhaps the other way around). Most obviously, beliefs function to be true, and to be used in reasoning, planning, decision-making, etc. Individual beliefs can be assessed against these functions: they can be true or false, well or poorly integrated into reasoning and planning, etc.

    - Likewise, valuing:
        - We have a capacity to value things. Why do we have such a capacity? What are its functions? What does this capacity enable us to do that we couldn't without it? How are particular exercises of that capacity---particular states of valuing---to be appraised?
            - Want an account of the adaptive function of having a capacity for valuing, and an account of standards on exercises of that capacity.
