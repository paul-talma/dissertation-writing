In some cases, standard reinforcement learning algorithms are not suitable for solving sequential decision problems.

Standard RL algorithms are ones that depend on a function $v: S \rightarrow \mathbb R$ that maps to each state its value, or a function $q: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb R$ that maps each state-action pair to its value.
