- the markov assumption is a kind of locality condition: the state at time t + 1 depends only on some local information: the state at time t.
- what happens when you look at other notions of locality?
    - for example, n-step markov assumption (feel like things wouldn't fundamentally change)S
    - are POMDPs a version of this? The partial observability isn't so much a broadening of the notion of locality as its erosion under cognitive constraints.
        - the markov space is still there, behind the observation space.
        - 

- What aspects of the choice situation do MDPs model?

- multiagent  RL
- summer school on RL
- psych lit critcal of RL
- value assertions/propositional?
- puzzle: why is the model-based argument so much better than the modelf-free argument?


Dayan and Niv (2008) on discounting
Temporal discounting: a recurrent controversy involves the way that the utilities of proximal and distant outcomes are weighed against each other. Exponential discounting, similar to a uniform interest rate, has attractive theoretical properties, notably the absence of intertemporal choice conflict, the possibility of recursive calculation scheme and simple prediction errors [1]. However, the more computationally complex hyperbolic discounting, which shows preference reversals and impulsivity, is a more common psychological finding in humans and animals [61].
