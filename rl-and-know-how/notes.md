- the markov assumption is a kind of locality condition: the state at time t + 1 depends only on some local information: the state at time t.
- what happens when you look at other notions of locality?
    - for example, n-step markov assumption (feel like things wouldn't fundamentally change)S
    - are POMDPs a version of this? The partial observability isn't so much a broadening of the notion of locality as its erosion under cognitive constraints.
        - the markov space is still there, behind the observation space.
        - 

- What aspects of the choice situation do MDPs model?
